# RepopCompanion
This is a simple web app companion for the game The Repopulation (https://therepopulation.com/) to pull data from the in-game database and display it in an easy-to-view format.
It was inspired by the excellent CraftMap site (http://aena.at/craftmap/craftmap.html).
It is still quite a ways away from feature complete and needs a serious styling overhaul, so please bear with us as we get it off the ground.
To contribute, please start in the "Prerequisites" folder for any framework and tool installs necessary.
